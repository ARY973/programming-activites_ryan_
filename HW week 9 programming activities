# Create a list of all even numbers from 2 to 100 (inclusive)

# Use list comprehension to strip spaces from each string
cleaned_list = [s.strip() for s in input_list]

#QUESTION 3 
# 1. Get the user's name

# 2. Change the string to be all upper case

# 3. Print the welcome message

#QUESTION 4 
# Initial sentence variable

# Print the sentence before any changes

# 2. Create a list called "words" using the split() function
words = sentence.split()

# Identify the index of the Whoa instances:
# The words are at index 10 and index 17
# Example: ['Dude,', 'I', 'just', 'biked', 'down', 'that', 'mountain', 'and', 'at', 'first', 'Whoa,', 'and', 'then', 'I', 'was', 'like', 'Whoa']

# Find the indices of the target word "Whoa" or "Whoa,"

# In the case of the provided sentence, after capitalize(), the words list is:
# ['Dude,', 'I', 'just', 'biked', 'down', 'that', 'mountain', 'and', 'at', 'first', 'I', 'was', 'like', 'Whoa,', 'and', 'then', 'I', 'was', 'like', 'Whoa']

# Correcting for the split (note: the comma attaches to the word):
# The first instance is 'Whoa,' (index 13)
# The second instance is 'Whoa' (index 19)

# 3. Change the first "Whoa," to "whoa," and the second "Whoa" to "WHOA"
# Assuming the list structure from the text example
try:
    # First instance (index 13 in the standard split of the original sentence)
    if words[13] == 'Whoa,':
        words[13] = 'whoa,'

    if words[19] == 'Whoa':
        words[19] = 'WHOA'
